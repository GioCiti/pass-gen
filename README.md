# pass-gen

In this project I used javascript to create a functional password generator
I was able to do this by:
- creating multiple js variables that served different purposes, such as storing information, creating prompts, creating alerts and many other things 
- using control flow statements like while and return
- utilized arrays to contain and apply user information
- .concat to merge my empty array to the other arrays
